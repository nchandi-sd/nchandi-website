                North County Hostpitals and Institutions (North County H&I) is a volunteer organization whose mission is to carry the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) message to those who still suffer and cannot get to an AA meeting.
                <br><br>
                Our core service is providing AA volunteer panels to treatment and correctional facilities in North San Diego county.  Panels are made up of AA volunteers who visit facilities on a weekly basis to share their individual stories of experience, strength and hope.
                <br><br>
                We are a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit organization registered as North County Area Institutions Committee (NCAIC).  We are funded by AA members through their AA group contributions and by individual contributions made to our Green Can program that is soley used for AA literature to residents in the facilities we serve.
